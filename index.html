            <h1>Fun Facts!</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cheesecakes date back to ancient Greece</h3>
                    <p>Yes, cheesecake might feel like a modern dessert but it actually dates all the way back to the
                        ancient world! When was cheesecake served? During the Olympic games! Not sure today's athletes
                        would think cake was a healthy fitness snack, but it must have been a nice treat!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The ancient Romans liked Cheesecake too</h3>
                    <p>The ancient Romans had their own cheesecake - Savillum. It was sweetened with honey instead of
                        sugar, and one ancient recipe suggests sprinkling poppy seeds on top. There's still recipes out
                        there for it today, if you want to try an authentic flavour of ancient Rome!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>It's been eaten all over the world for hundreds of years</h3>
                    <p>Yes, cheesecake really is that popular! As well as the ancient world, it was enjoyed in medieval
                        Italy where it was made in Ricotta, whereas in Germany it's made with quark! It's even found in
                        Colonial America in the 18th century; Philadelphia has it's own 'Cheesecake House' tavern!</p>
                </li>
                <!-- 
                <li>
                    <h3>Forme of Cury, an English cookbook from 1390, contains a cheesecake recipe</h3>
                    <p>The book actually has TWO cheesecake recipes; one for something called 'Sambocade' and another
                        called 'Tart de bry', both of which are recognisable as close recipes to modern cheesecakes! The
                        book was written by the cooks of King Richard II, so it's fair to say it was cheesecake fit for
                        a king!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>American cheesecake is different</h3>
                    <p>You may have had 'New York Cheesecake' and noticed it's a bit different from other cheesecakes -
                        that's because the Americans make theirs a little differently! Firstly, American cheesecake is
                        baked in the oven, whereas European cheesecake is cooled in the fridge. It's also a lot more
                        custardy than a European style cheese cake, which is much creamier.</p>

                <button>Order</button>
                <p>Japanese cheesecake is very different from regular cheesecake. It is cotton soft, light, fluffy and
                    jiggly, due
                    to the meringue egg white mixture in the recipe.</p>

                <p>The perfect ending to
                    an outdoor dinner and though the cheesecake is just as rich the fresh fruit brings a welcome
                    brightness to it making it one of our favorite summer desserts. </p>
